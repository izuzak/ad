loading text within ad:

    - as we saw on the last slide, text can be interacted with inside of ad buffers

    - there are two ways to "Load" text in this way:

        - right click on the path with your mouse
        - place the cursor on the path and press Enter

    - "Loading" within ad is a contextual operation that you have control over

        ../../src/editor/actions.rs:/default_load_dot/

    - plumbing rules control how text is interpreted

        ../../data/plumbing.rules
        ls(1)

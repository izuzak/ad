this presentation uses this interface:

    - the "buttons" above are just shell scripts:

        ../../data/bin/NextSlide
        ../../data/bin/PrevSlide
        ../../data/bin/Slide

    - a more advanced helper script is ../../data/bin/rust-check

    - it makes use of the buffer events file to re-interpret Load and Execute events
      and monitor when files are saved

interacting with ad from other programs:

    - ad uses the 9p file protocol to present a virtual filesystem interface

        http://man.cat-v.org/plan_9/5/

    - if you have the 9p(1) command line utility installed you can explore the filesystem
      
        9p ls ad
        9p ls ad/buffers/1
        9p read ad/buffers/1/dot

    - if you have the fusermount(1) and 9pfuse(4) programs installed then you can set the
      "auto-mount" property in ../../data/config.toml to true and mount the filesystem directly

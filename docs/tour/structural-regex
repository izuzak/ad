structural regular expressions:

    - the Edit command from the last slide looked a lot like a normal sed expression:

          Edit , s/mouse/clicky thing/g

    - but the syntax supported in ad is a lot richer than you might expect

        - s/re/template/         substitute (equivalent to "x/re/ c/template/")
        - x/re/                  loop over matches
        - y/re/                  loop between matches ("split on re")
        - g/re/                  filter matching
        - v/re/                  filter non-matching
        - i/template/            insert before each match
        - a/template/            insert after each match
        - c/template/            replace each match
        - d                      delete each match
        - p/template/            print with a string template
        - P                      print the match

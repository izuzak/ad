all you need is read & write:

    - the ad repo contains some example scripts for interacting with ad:

        ../../data/lib/ad.sh
        ../../data/bin

    - there is also the ad_client crate which provides a way to interact with ad from Rust:

        ../../crates/ad_client

    - if you can talk 9p, you can interact with and control ad

    - if you have fuse available, all you need is the ability to read and write files
